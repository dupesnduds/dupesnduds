## Hi there 👋  
I'm **Dupes** (aka **Drac**). In and out of the NZ IT scene since dial-up. I build what works, skip the hype, and don’t do arse-kissing.

Mobile dev. DFIR & red-team tinkerer.  
No degree—just scars, tools, and code that got shit done.  
Technical enough to break things, fix them, and still annoy management.

> **dupesnduds** is my open lab: forensic tooling, automation scripts, adversarial PoCs, Kotlin apps, and domain-specific LLM fine-tuning. Everything here either fixed something real—or taught me something real.

---

### 🔭 Focus areas right now
- Fine-tuning LLMs for trade, forensic, and incident-response workflows.
- CLI tools for skills verification, forensic imaging, and audit trails.
- Kotlin mobile tools and PoCs. (iOS port: supply hardware.)

---

### 🌱 I’m learning & refining
- Rust-based disk imaging with built-in verification and tamper-proof logs  
- DFIR/red-team pipelines in Python, Bash, Rust  
- Publishable incident-response case studies, tradecraft notes, and post-mortems

---

### 💬 Ask me about
- Disk imaging, hash verification, and chain-of-custody tooling
- Carpentry workflows, trade skills assessment, and practical compliance
- Engineering on both iOS and Android  
- Productivity tooling for neurodivergent engineers  
- Lightweight automation for red teams or CI pipelines

### ⚡ Wellington & No Formal Qualifications

| Option | What you’ll still have to do |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Build a portfolio | Pray it convinces someone beyond the degree filter |
| Get certs | Pray in tree pose |
| Get a BSc | Get on your knees and pray harder |
| Start your own SME | Pray that it pays in downward-facing dog pose |
| Screw it all and code for fun | Work on projects that actually hire on ability |

Facts:
- **≈ 103 digital-forensics jobs in Wellington** listed on Seek—nearly all require a degree or recognized qualification.
- **106 entry-level developer roles** in Wellington CBD often demand tertiary education.
- Police DFIR tech roles require either a qualifying IT university degree *or* ≥ 3 years of equivalent experience and certifications.
- Self-taught work is absolutely possible—but nearly everyone notes it’s *much harder* without official credentials.

If you want to succeed here without a degree ... pray.

### 🛠 Tech stack  
Rust · Python · Bash · Kotlin · Swift · Objective‑C · C/C++ · .NET/C# · GitHub Actions · Linux · macOS (± Windows) · etcetera, etcetera.

### 🤝 Collaboration & expectations
- PRs welcome if they’re tactical, meaningful, and friction-reducing  
- Issues only if they’re about tools/code—no SEO pitches or vague bullshit  
- Want help with DFIR, mobile tooling, red-team infra, or AI-forensics in NZ? Hit me up via contact above or create an issue.
